# Password Generator
In this application, I wrote the JavaScript for a random password generator. 

The URL of the live application is:

Initially the user has to choose the desired length of the password. It can be 8-128 characters, and if the user chooses outside this range, they are prompted to choose again.
The user then is prompted to choose if they want to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and/or special characters.

When the button is clicked, a random secure password appears in the text area.

This was a challenging exercise. I researched for a long time and had some pointers from a tutor and TAs. Enjoy.
